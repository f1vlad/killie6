killie6 (experimental development version)
=======

Killie6 is a website plug-in to achieve nothing short of tricking your website 
visitor into downloading a more recent version of Internet Explorer.

This plug-in activates only on Internet Explorer 6. Hence the name of the 
project killie6 (Kill IE6)

Despite a negative word in the name of the plug-in, the aim of this is truly
positive. I will help both developers and your website visitors.
